# MyFarm
This programming exercise has four parts consisting of four requirements. The grade for each requirement is indicated, for a maximum of 100 points. At a minimum, your program must compile successfully and run.  Using classes and objects, implement a farm. Create a class containing a Main() function that exercises your other classes. Create classes representing several types of domesticated animals, such as cows, sheep, chickens, goats, etc. Instantiate several objects of each class. For example, for your Rabbit class, you might instantiate objects Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit, Thumper, and Peter Cottontail.
